# errors-dashboard Specification

## Purpose
The Errors page: failed tool calls of every coding agent by type, with fixes. This spec covers how failures group into incidents and how the page compares error rates.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Group failures into incidents
The Errors page SHALL group failed tool calls into incidents, each a retry loop of one agent: failures of one tool by one agent (the main thread or one subagent) with one error type, each starting at most 10 minutes after the previous one ended, with at most 2 successful calls of that tool by that agent in between.

#### Scenario: Retry after a check
- **WHEN** a subagent's `Bash` call fails, one `Bash` call succeeds, and the same `Bash` error follows two minutes later
- **THEN** both failures are one incident with 1 successful call in between

#### Scenario: The agent moved on
- **WHEN** 3 successful `Bash` calls come between two failures of the same type by one agent
- **THEN** the failures are two incidents

#### Scenario: Two subagents
- **WHEN** two subagents of one session each fail `Bash` with the same error a minute apart
- **THEN** the failures are two incidents

### Requirement: Say how an incident ended
An incident's outcome SHALL be what its agent's next call of the tool, started after the incident's last failure ended, did: recovered if it succeeded, failed again if it failed, given up if there was none.

#### Scenario: Parallel call
- **WHEN** a `Bash` call starts before an incident's last failure ended and succeeds, and no later `Bash` call follows
- **THEN** the incident is given up, not recovered

### Requirement: Compare error rates one way
The Errors page SHALL compare error rates the same way in the summary, the type table and Rising fastest: a range against the same number of days just before it; all time, the calls before and since the day that splits its calls in half. It SHALL show no change when either side has fewer than 200 tool calls, and say why. A type with fewer than 5 errors on either side SHALL show its counts instead of a percent.

#### Scenario: Thin start
- **WHEN** the store holds 11 tool calls in June and thousands from late September on, and the user picks All
- **THEN** the halves split inside the busy period, and no type reads as new because of June

#### Scenario: No calls before the range
- **WHEN** the 7 days before the range hold no tool calls
- **THEN** Change shows "–" with "Fewer than 200 tool calls in the 7 days before"

#### Scenario: Few errors
- **WHEN** a type had 2 errors in the previous 30 days and 9 in this range
- **THEN** the table shows "2 → 9"

### Requirement: Show the uncategorized share
The Errors summary SHALL show the share of the view's errors in the catch-all types (Other, Other non-zero exit and MCP tool error), which are the errors no specific rule matched, with a title that says so. When the view is not filtered to one source and more than one source has errors, the line SHALL split the share by source. It SHALL show nothing when the view has no errors.

#### Scenario: Share shows
- **WHEN** the view has errors, and 12 of 100 of them are of catch-all types
- **THEN** the summary shows "Uncategorized: 12% of errors", titled with the catch-all types and what they mean

#### Scenario: Split by source
- **WHEN** the view has no source filter and both Claude Code and Codex have errors in it
- **THEN** the line adds each source's share in parentheses, such as "(Claude Code 9%, Codex 31%)"
- **AND** a view filtered to one source shows the share alone

### Requirement: State each type's time lost
The Errors page SHALL state each error type's time lost: the sum, over the view's incidents of that type, of each incident's span, from its first failure's start to its last failure's end. An incident SHALL count whole when at least one of its failures is in the view. A type whose incidents have no measurable span SHALL show no time. The page SHALL rank the open types that have a ready-made fix by time lost, most first, then by error count, and show each one's time lost.

#### Scenario: Fewer errors, more time lost
- **WHEN** one open type has 3 errors in two incidents of 10 minutes each, and another has 4 errors in one incident of 1 minute
- **THEN** Where to start lists the first type above the second, and the type table shows 20 min and 1 min

#### Scenario: Equal time lost
- **WHEN** two open types lost the same time
- **THEN** the one with more errors is listed first

#### Scenario: Incident partly outside the view
- **WHEN** an incident's first failure is before the range and its last failure is inside it
- **THEN** the incident's whole span counts toward its type's time lost

#### Scenario: No measurable span
- **WHEN** a type's only incident is one failure with no recorded duration
- **THEN** its time lost reads "–"
