# dashboard-app Specification

## Purpose

Runs as a single local process that owns the transcript store, keeps it current, and serves the Activity, Cost and Errors dashboards behind one shared navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Serve only on localhost
The app SHALL listen only on `127.0.0.1` and SHALL NOT expose transcript data on any other interface.

#### Scenario: Request from another host
- **WHEN** another machine on the network connects to the app's port
- **THEN** the connection is refused

### Requirement: Keep the store current
The app SHALL ingest new transcript data when it starts and then on a fixed interval while it runs, and SHALL offer a manual refresh.

#### Scenario: New session while app runs
- **WHEN** a new Claude Code session writes transcript lines while the app is running
- **THEN** those lines appear in both dashboards within one ingest interval, without a restart

#### Scenario: Manual refresh
- **WHEN** the user clicks refresh
- **THEN** the app ingests immediately and the page shows the new data and the time of the last ingest

### Requirement: Single owner of the store
Only one process SHALL write to the store at a time. A second app or command-line ingest SHALL fail with a clear message instead of corrupting or blocking the store.

#### Scenario: App already running
- **WHEN** the user runs a command-line ingest while the app is running
- **THEN** the command exits with a non-zero status and a message saying the app owns the store

### Requirement: Shared navigation
Every dashboard page SHALL show the same navigation with Activity, Cost and Errors entries, mark the current page, and keep the selected project and time range when switching pages.

#### Scenario: Switch from Usage to Errors
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Activity (`/usage`) and clicks Errors
- **THEN** the errors dashboard opens filtered to `foo` and the last 30 days

#### Scenario: Switch from Activity to Cost
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Activity and clicks Cost
- **THEN** the cost dashboard opens filtered to `foo` and the last 30 days

### Requirement: Errors dashboard served from the store
The errors dashboard SHALL read its data from the store and SHALL keep its existing behavior: error categories with suggested fixes, per-example (`#ex=<tool_use_id>`) and per-category (`#cat=<type>`) permalinks, and applied-fix markers.

#### Scenario: Existing permalink
- **WHEN** the user opens an errors dashboard URL with `#ex=<tool_use_id>` copied before this change
- **THEN** that example is focused, as before

#### Scenario: Error from a deleted transcript
- **WHEN** an error's transcript file was deleted after ingest
- **THEN** the error still appears in the errors dashboard

#### Scenario: Fix marked before the rebuild
- **WHEN** the user marked a fix as applied on the errors dashboard before this change
- **THEN** the marker still shows on its date with the before and after error rate

### Requirement: Open Activity by default
The app SHALL serve Activity at `/usage`, Cost at `/cost` and Errors at `/errors`, and SHALL send `/` to Activity.

#### Scenario: Open the app root
- **WHEN** the user opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`
- **THEN** the Activity page opens

### Requirement: Run without a frontend toolchain
The app SHALL serve every dashboard page from files in the repository, so running it needs only Python and its Python dependencies. A frontend toolchain SHALL be needed only to change the pages.

#### Scenario: Fresh clone without Node
- **WHEN** the user clones the repository on a machine without Node and runs the app
- **THEN** Activity, Cost and Errors all load and work

### Requirement: Exclude automated sessions by default
Activity and Cost SHALL leave out sessions from known automated projects (today `observer-sessions`) from every figure, chart and table, and SHALL offer a control to include them. The choice SHALL be kept in the page URL and carried across pages. A project filter that names an automated project SHALL include that project's sessions.

#### Scenario: Default view
- **WHEN** the store holds 631 `observer-sessions` sessions and 872 other sessions in the last 30 days
- **THEN** Activity counts 872 sessions for that range and `observer-sessions` does not appear in its tables or the project picker

#### Scenario: Include automated sessions
- **WHEN** the user turns on the control to include automated sessions
- **THEN** Activity counts 1,503 sessions, `observer-sessions` appears in its tables, and the URL records the choice

#### Scenario: Filter names an automated project
- **WHEN** the user opens Activity with `#project=observer-sessions` and the control off
- **THEN** Activity shows the `observer-sessions` sessions, and the project picker shows `observer-sessions` as the selected project
