# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Name the app AI Ledger
Every dashboard page SHALL show the app's name, AI Ledger, in its navigation brand and in its browser title, after the page's own name.

#### Scenario: Page titles
- **WHEN** the user opens `/usage`, `/cost` and `/errors`
- **THEN** the browser titles are `Activity · AI Ledger`, `Cost · AI Ledger` and `Errors · AI Ledger`

#### Scenario: Navigation brand
- **WHEN** any dashboard page is open
- **THEN** the navigation shows `AI Ledger` and no longer shows `Claude ledger`

### Requirement: Keep browser state through the rename
Choices the pages saved in the browser before the rename SHALL still apply after it: applied-fix markers, the last Errors view and list mode, the Activity and Cost chart metrics, and hidden Cost sections.

#### Scenario: Saved chart metric
- **WHEN** the user chose `prompts` for the Activity chart before the rename
- **THEN** Activity opens with `prompts` selected after the rename

#### Scenario: Applied fix
- **WHEN** the user marked a fix as applied on the Errors page before the rename
- **THEN** the marker still shows on its date after the rename
