# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Keep the store current
The app SHALL ingest new transcript data when it starts and then on a fixed interval while it runs, and SHALL offer a manual refresh. While at least one Live page is connected, the app SHALL ingest transcripts every second. Usage data and plan limits SHALL keep their own interval.

#### Scenario: New session while app runs
- **WHEN** a new Claude Code session writes transcript lines while the app is running
- **THEN** those lines appear in both dashboards within one ingest interval, without a restart

#### Scenario: Manual refresh
- **WHEN** the user clicks refresh
- **THEN** the app ingests immediately and the page shows the new data and the time of the last ingest

#### Scenario: Live page open
- **WHEN** a Live page is connected and a session writes a line
- **THEN** the line is in the store within 1 second of being written

#### Scenario: Live page closed
- **WHEN** the last Live page disconnects
- **THEN** the app goes back to ingesting on its fixed interval

### Requirement: Shared navigation
Every dashboard page SHALL show the same navigation with Activity, Cost, Errors, Limits, Insights and Live entries, mark the current page, and keep the selected project and time range when switching pages.

#### Scenario: Switch from Usage to Errors
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Activity (`/usage`) and clicks Errors
- **THEN** the errors dashboard opens filtered to `foo` and the last 30 days

#### Scenario: Switch from Activity to Cost
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Activity and clicks Cost
- **THEN** the cost dashboard opens filtered to `foo` and the last 30 days

#### Scenario: Switch from Cost to Limits
- **WHEN** the user views Codex for the last 30 days on Cost and clicks Limits
- **THEN** the Limits page opens filtered to Codex and the last 30 days

#### Scenario: Switch from Cost to Insights
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Cost and clicks Insights
- **THEN** the Insights page opens filtered to `foo` and the last 30 days

#### Scenario: Through Live and back
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Cost, clicks Live, then clicks Cost
- **THEN** Live shows only `foo` sessions, and Cost opens again on `foo` and the last 30 days

### Requirement: Open Activity by default
The app SHALL serve Activity at `/usage`, Cost at `/cost`, Errors at `/errors`, Limits at `/limits`, Insights at `/insights` and Live at `/live`, and SHALL send `/` to Activity.

#### Scenario: Open the app root
- **WHEN** the user opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`
- **THEN** the Activity page opens

#### Scenario: Open Limits directly
- **WHEN** the user opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765/limits`
- **THEN** the Limits page opens

#### Scenario: Open Insights
- **WHEN** the user opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765/insights`
- **THEN** the Insights page opens

#### Scenario: Open Live
- **WHEN** the user opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765/live`
- **THEN** the Live page opens

### Requirement: Name the app AI Ledger
Every dashboard page SHALL show the app's name, AI Ledger, in its navigation brand and in its browser title, after the page's own name.

#### Scenario: Page titles
- **WHEN** the user opens `/usage`, `/cost`, `/errors`, `/insights` and `/live`
- **THEN** the browser titles are `Activity · AI Ledger`, `Cost · AI Ledger`, `Errors · AI Ledger`, `Insights · AI Ledger` and `Live · AI Ledger`

#### Scenario: Navigation brand
- **WHEN** any dashboard page is open
- **THEN** the navigation shows `AI Ledger` and no longer shows `Claude ledger`

### Requirement: Filter by source
Activity, Cost, Errors, Limits, Insights and Live SHALL offer a source filter with the choices All, Claude Code and Codex, defaulting to All. Every figure, chart and table on the page SHALL reflect the chosen source. The choice SHALL be kept in the page URL and carried across pages with the project and time range.

#### Scenario: Default shows every source
- **WHEN** the user opens Cost with no source in the URL, and the last 30 days hold $120 of Claude usage and $15 of Codex usage
- **THEN** Cost shows $135 for the period

#### Scenario: Narrow to Codex
- **WHEN** the user picks Codex on Activity
- **THEN** every figure, chart and table shows only Codex sessions, and the URL records `source=codex`

#### Scenario: Switch pages with a source
- **WHEN** the user views Codex for the last 30 days on Activity and clicks Errors
- **THEN** the errors dashboard opens filtered to Codex and the last 30 days

#### Scenario: Unknown source in the URL
- **WHEN** the URL holds `source=grok`
- **THEN** the page shows All and replaces the value in the URL

#### Scenario: Codex on Insights
- **WHEN** the user views Codex on Activity and clicks Insights
- **THEN** Insights opens with source Codex and says that `/insights` analyses only Claude Code sessions

#### Scenario: Codex on Live
- **WHEN** the user picks Codex on Live
- **THEN** the rail and the wall show only Codex sessions
