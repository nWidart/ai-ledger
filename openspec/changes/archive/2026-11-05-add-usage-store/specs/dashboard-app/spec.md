# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Runs as a single local process that owns the transcript store, keeps it current, and serves the Errors and Usage dashboards behind one shared navigation.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Serve only on localhost
The app SHALL listen only on `127.0.0.1` and SHALL NOT expose transcript data on any other interface.

#### Scenario: Request from another host
- **WHEN** another machine on the network connects to the app's port
- **THEN** the connection is refused

### Requirement: Keep the store current
The app SHALL ingest new transcript data when it starts and then on a fixed interval while it runs, and SHALL offer a manual refresh.

#### Scenario: New session while app runs
- **WHEN** a new Claude Code session writes transcript lines while the app is running
- **THEN** those lines appear in both dashboards within one ingest interval, without a restart

#### Scenario: Manual refresh
- **WHEN** the user clicks refresh
- **THEN** the app ingests immediately and the page shows the new data and the time of the last ingest

### Requirement: Single owner of the store
Only one process SHALL write to the store at a time. A second app or command-line ingest SHALL fail with a clear message instead of corrupting or blocking the store.

#### Scenario: App already running
- **WHEN** the user runs a command-line ingest while the app is running
- **THEN** the command exits with a non-zero status and a message saying the app owns the store

### Requirement: Shared navigation
Every dashboard page SHALL show the same navigation with Errors and Usage entries, mark the current page, and keep the selected project and time range when switching pages.

#### Scenario: Switch from Usage to Errors
- **WHEN** the user views project `foo` for the last 30 days on Usage and clicks Errors
- **THEN** the errors dashboard opens filtered to `foo` and the last 30 days

### Requirement: Errors dashboard served from the store
The errors dashboard SHALL read its data from the store and SHALL keep its existing behavior: error categories with suggested fixes, per-example (`#ex=<tool_use_id>`) and per-category (`#cat=<type>`) permalinks, and applied-fix markers.

#### Scenario: Existing permalink
- **WHEN** the user opens an errors dashboard URL with `#ex=<tool_use_id>` copied before this change
- **THEN** that example is focused, as before

#### Scenario: Error from a deleted transcript
- **WHEN** an error's transcript file was deleted after ingest
- **THEN** the error still appears in the errors dashboard
