# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Keep the store current
The app SHALL ingest new transcript data when it starts and then on a fixed interval while it runs, and SHALL offer a manual refresh. While at least one Live page is connected, the app SHALL ingest transcripts every second. Usage data and plan limits SHALL keep their own interval. The time of the last ingest in the navigation SHALL stay current: it follows the app's status on a fixed interval, and while the Live page is open it also follows each change notice the page receives.

#### Scenario: New session while app runs
- **WHEN** a new Claude Code session writes transcript lines while the app is running
- **THEN** those lines appear in both dashboards within one ingest interval, without a restart

#### Scenario: Manual refresh
- **WHEN** the user clicks refresh
- **THEN** the app ingests immediately and the page shows the new data and the time of the last ingest

#### Scenario: Ingest with nothing new
- **WHEN** a timed ingest stores no new lines and no usage data
- **THEN** the open page does not refetch or redraw its data; only the time of the last ingest changes

#### Scenario: Live page open
- **WHEN** a Live page is connected and a session writes a line
- **THEN** the line is in the store within 1 second of being written

#### Scenario: Live page closed
- **WHEN** the last Live page disconnects
- **THEN** the app goes back to ingesting on its fixed interval

#### Scenario: Last ingest follows Live
- **WHEN** the Live page is open, the navigation shows "Last ingest" with a time 50 seconds old, and the page receives a change notice
- **THEN** the navigation shows the time of the ingest that stored those lines, within 2 seconds, without waiting for its own poll

#### Scenario: Notices in quick succession
- **WHEN** the Live page receives a change notice each second for ten seconds
- **THEN** the page asks for the app's status at most once at a time, and the navigation shows the newest ingest time

#### Scenario: Paused Live page
- **WHEN** the Live page is paused and receives change notices
- **THEN** the navigation keeps the time it shows until the user resumes, and then shows the newest
